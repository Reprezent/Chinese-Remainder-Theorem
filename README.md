# Chinese-Remainder-Theorem
Simple program to perform that factors and figures out the Chinese Remainder Theorem of a cyclic group of size N.

The Chinese Remainder Theorm is a way to compute Group Isomorphisms between any two elements within the group. Allowing for easily producing and creating multiple gruop isomorphisism that map to the larger grouping.

Build the file with make.

usage: ./crm N
- Where N is the number in order to make the cyclic group.
